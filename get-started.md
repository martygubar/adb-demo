# Get Started with Autonomous Database

## Scenario Background: Oracle MovieStream
Most of the demonstrations listed here will use Oracle MovieStream, a fictitious on-line movie streaming company, as the business scenario. To give you background into MovieStream, see the video below:
* Simplify your data architecture by eliminating data silos
* By eliminating silos – you can now more easily infuse your applications with intelligence
* Developers should not have to make compromises - use a data platform that offers APIs that best match the application development needs
* And finally, you can’t forget that Non-functional requirements: security, high availability, scalability - are critical!

**Use the following video as the basis. Requires updates**

## Create and load tables from a variety of sources
Data is stored in a variety of file types (CSV, JSON, Apache Parquet) in an Oracle Object Storage data lake. Create database tables and import that data **without writing a single line of code**. It's never been easier or more productive.

## Analyze your data with SQL
SQL is the language of data - and Autonomous Database offers the **industry's leading SQL engine**. Take a look at how you can gain insights from different types of data in different data stores, including tabular data in database tables and JSON data on Oracle Object Storage.

You'll use analytic SQL to find at-risk customers and then use spatial analytics to create a localized offer. It doesn't matter where the data lives - just write your SQL queries and Autonomous Database will do the rest.
