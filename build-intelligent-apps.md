Let's look at the components of the application.

## Introducing Oracle MovieStream
Oracle MovieStream is a fictitious on-line movie streaming application. These demonstrations will highlight how MovieStream is able to deliver intelligent applications on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure that are powered by Autonomous Database. MovieStream achieved many benefits that all customers can learn from:
* Simplify your data architecture by eliminating data silos
* By eliminating silos – you can now more easily infuse your applications with intelligence
* Developers should not have to make compromises - use a data platform that offers APIs that best match the application development needs
* And finally, you can’t forget that Non-functional requirements: security, high availability, scalability - are critical!

## Use modern APIs for application development
Time to market is critical and developer productivity is the key to success. Autonomous Database offers a range of APIs - including MongoDB, Oracle SODA or Oracle REST Data Services - to meet developer productivity requirements. 

Develop your application using a schemaless JSON data model. This allows for a hybrid development approach: all of the schema flexibility and speedy application development of NoSQL document stores, combined with all of the enterprise-ready features in Autonomous Database.
